# Term 1

## Project: Detect Lane Lines

Detect highway lane lines from a video stream. Use OpenCV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough transforms and Canny edge detection.

## Deep Learning

* Machine Learning: Review fundamentals of machine learning, including regression and classification.

* Neural Networks: Learn about perceptrons, activation functions, and basic neural networks. Implement your own neural network in Python.

* Logistic Classifier: Study how to train a logistic classifier, using machine learning. Implement a logistic classifier in TensorFlow.

* Optimization: Investigate techniques for optimizing classifier performance, including validation and test sets, gradient descent, momentum, and learning rates.

* Rectified Linear Units: Evaluate activation functions and how they affect performance.

* Regularization: Learn techniques, including dropout, to avoid overfitting a network to the training data.

* Convolutional Neural Networks: Study the building blocks of convolutional neural networks, including filters, stride, and pooling.

## Project: Traffic Sign Classification

Implement and train a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. Use validation sets, pooling, and dropout to choose a network architecture and improve performance.

* Keras: Build a multi-layer convolutional network in Keras. Compare the simplicity of Keras to the flexibility of TensorFlow.

* Transfer Learning: Finetune pre-trained networks to solve your own problems. Study cannonical networks such as AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet.

## Project: Behavioral Cloning

Architect and train a deep neural network to drive a car in a simulator. Collect your own training data and use it to clone your own driving behavior on a test track.

## Computer Vision

* Cameras: Learn the physics of cameras, and how to calibrate, undistort, and transform image perspectives.

* Lane Finding: Study advanced techniques for lane detection with curved roads, adverse weather, and varied lighting.

## Project: Advanced Lane Detection

Detect lane lines in a variety of conditions, including changing road surfaces, curved roads, and variable lighting. Use OpenCV to implement camera calibration and transforms, as well as filters, polynomial fits, and splines.

* Support Vector Machines: Implement support vector machines and apply them to image classification.

* Decision Trees: Implement decision trees and apply them to image classification.

* Histogram of Oriented Gradients: Implement histogram of oriented gradients and apply it to image classification.

* Deep Neural Networks: Compare the classification performance of support vector machines, decision trees, histogram of oriented gradients, and deep neural networks.

* Vehicle Tracking: Review how to apply image classification techniques to vehicle tracking, along with basic filters to integrate vehicle position over time.

## Project: Vehicle Tracking

* Track vehicles in camera images using image classifiers such as SVMs, decision trees, HOG, and DNNs. Apply filters to fuse position data.
